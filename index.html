            <p class="description">When ABBA, Bee Gees, and Stevie Wonder were thriving in radio stations and nightclubs, a life-threatening virus loomed out from the shadows and thrived in causing trouble to global public health.</p>

                At the end of the 70s towards the early 80s, HIV surfaced earlier in Central Africa and began spreading intermittently across the globe. This virus then inevitably made its way into the United States and caused a national crisis—a crisis that unnecessarily claimed countless lives (PublicHealth.org, 2022)<sup><a href="https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/hiv-aids/origin-story/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Dubbed as the “gay disease” or “LGBT disease” as noted by the Human Rights Campaign (n.d.), HIV and the latent syndrome it manifests, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), remained unidentified in 1981 and continued to cause suffering to homosexual men. This, in turn, became a primary threat to public health by the late 1980s<sup><a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/debunking-common-myths-about-hiv" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Yet, years after the CDC made the connection between the illnesses that emerged across different communities with this suspected virus, the American government barely did anything to address the pandemic. Since then, the state left more than half a million Americans to die of AIDS, neglected afflicted groups (gay men, intravenous drug users, racial minorities, and immigrants), and caused a huge public outcry from activists, artists, medical professionals, and HIV+ persons (Yehia & Frank, 2011)<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154226/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                The World Health Organization (n.d.) defined the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a type of infection that is sexually transmitted and then affects the immune system, specifically the T cells—a type of white blood cell. Consequently, this invasion weakens the body’s immunity against pathogens like tuberculosis, severe bacterial infections, and several cancers<sup><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Once your body is infected with HIV, you have it for life. And when left untreated, the infection can lead to AIDS—a potentially life-threatening point at which you have a dangerously low count of T cells, leading to death in a short amount of time (Planned Parenthood, n.d.)<sup><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Planned Parenthood (n.d.) estimates that about 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV, and there are more than 38 thousand new infections annually. The symptoms of the viral infection remain under the radar for many years, so untested individuals might not even know they have it<sup><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Today, there is still no cure for HIV, but with early tests and effective drug treatments, HIV+ persons will be able to live a long and healthy life and avoid any AIDS-related illnesses (National Health Service, 2021)<sup><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>. So it is emphasized to take preventative measures against HIV infection by practicing safe sex (i.e. wearing condoms or taking pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, for high-risk individuals).
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                So in this article, we will explore various outcomes of the propagation of HIV through modeling and simulation. However, let us first establish the plan of our exploration by using the following guide questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="list">What are the parameters that drive the transmission of HIV infection?</li>
                <li class="list">What is the outcome when no one practices safe sex and refuses to get tested?</li>
                <li class="list">How about when some partners use condoms but still refuse to get tested?</li>
                <li class="list">What does the outcome look like when individuals occasionally get tested but prefer unprotected sex?</li>
                <li class="list">Lastly, how about when everyone uses condoms and regularly gets tested for HIV?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="section-divider">The simulations</h3>
            <p class="main">
                Say, we have a contained city with a population of 50. And in it, everyone has a chance to mingle and form a relationship at some amount of time.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/01 Initialization.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                Let us introduce HIV to the population. The red persons are those who know they are infected (HIV+); the yellow persons are the unsuspected or those who do not know they are infected (HIV?); green are those uninfected (HIV-).
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/02 Agents.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                And this is what an infection event looks like. Notice how the HIV- person gets into a sexual relationship with an HIV? person, and gets infected at some point.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/02.5 Infection.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                Then, we define the parameters that characterize HIV among an individual:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">Positivity — whether or not an individual is HIV+ or not.</li>
                <li class="list">Known — does the HIV+ individual know they are infected?</li>
                <li class="list">Infection probability — the probability that an HIV+ person infects their sexual partner.</li>
                <li class="list">Condom use — the probability of the couple’s use of condoms.</li>
                <li class="list">Testing frequency — the number of times an individual gets tested for HIV per year.</li>
                <li class="list">Partnering probability — likeliness that an individual enters a commits to a new relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main">
                According to a meta-analysis conducted by Baggaley, White, & Boily (2010), there is a 40.4% chance of transmission for per-partner unprotected receptive anal intercourse<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20406794/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>. Hence, we set the infection probability respectively.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Now let us see this in action, but with a population of 400 and 3% of it are initially infected. Note that in this simulation, no one uses a condom and refuses to get tested.
