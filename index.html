            <p class="description">When ABBA, Bee Gees, and Stevie Wonder were thriving in radio stations and nightclubs, a life-threatening virus loomed out from the shadows and thrived in causing trouble to global public health.</p>

                At the end of the 70s towards the early 80s, HIV surfaced earlier in Central Africa and began spreading intermittently across the globe. This virus then inevitably made its way into the United States and caused a national crisis—a crisis that unnecessarily claimed countless lives (PublicHealth.org, 2022)<sup><a href="https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/hiv-aids/origin-story/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Dubbed as the “gay disease” or “LGBT disease” as noted by the Human Rights Campaign (n.d.), HIV and the latent syndrome it manifests, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), remained unidentified in 1981 and continued to cause suffering to homosexual men. This, in turn, became a primary threat to public health by the late 1980s<sup><a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/debunking-common-myths-about-hiv" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Yet, years after the CDC made the connection between the illnesses that emerged across different communities with this suspected virus, the American government barely did anything to address the pandemic. Since then, the state left more than half a million Americans to die of AIDS, neglected afflicted groups (gay men, intravenous drug users, racial minorities, and immigrants), and caused a huge public outcry from activists, artists, medical professionals, and HIV+ persons (Yehia & Frank, 2011)<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154226/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>.

                The World Health Organization (n.d.) defined the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a type of infection that is sexually transmitted and then affects the immune system, specifically the T cells—a type of white blood cell. Consequently, this invasion weakens the body’s immunity against pathogens like tuberculosis, severe bacterial infections, and several cancers<sup><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Once your body is infected with HIV, you have it for life. And when left untreated, the infection can lead to AIDS—a potentially life-threatening point at which you have a dangerously low count of T cells, leading to death in a short amount of time (Planned Parenthood, n.d.)<sup><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Planned Parenthood (n.d.) estimates that about 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV, and there are more than 38 thousand new infections annually. The symptoms of the viral infection remain under the radar for many years, so untested individuals might not even know they have it<sup><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Today, there is still no cure for HIV, but with early tests and effective drug treatments, HIV+ persons will be able to live a long and healthy life and avoid any AIDS-related illnesses (National Health Service, 2021)<sup><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>. So it is emphasized to take preventative measures against HIV infection by practicing safe sex (i.e. wearing condoms or taking pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, for high-risk individuals).
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                So in this article, we will explore various outcomes of the propagation of HIV through modeling and simulation. However, let us first establish the plan of our exploration by using the following guide questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="list">What are the parameters that drive the transmission of HIV infection?</li>
                <li class="list">What is the outcome when no one practices safe sex and refuses to get tested?</li>
                <li class="list">How about when some partners use condoms but still refuse to get tested?</li>
                <li class="list">What does the outcome look like when individuals occasionally get tested but prefer unprotected sex?</li>
                <li class="list">Lastly, how about when everyone uses condoms and regularly gets tested for HIV?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="section-divider">The simulations</h3>
            <p class="main">
                Say, we have a contained city with a population of 50. And in it, everyone has a chance to mingle and form a relationship at some amount of time.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/01 Initialization.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                Let us introduce HIV to the population. The red persons are those who know they are infected (HIV+); the yellow persons are the unsuspected or those who do not know they are infected (HIV?); green are those uninfected (HIV-).
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/02 Agents.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                And this is what an infection event looks like. Notice how the HIV- person gets into a sexual relationship with an HIV? person, and gets infected at some point.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="static/img/02.5 Infection.gif" class="gif-viewer">
            </div>
            <p class="main">
                Then, we define the parameters that characterize HIV among an individual:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">Positivity — whether or not an individual is HIV+ or not.</li>
                <li class="list">Known — does the HIV+ individual know they are infected?</li>
                <li class="list">Infection probability — the probability that an HIV+ person infects their sexual partner.</li>
                <li class="list">Condom use — the probability of the couple's use of condoms.</li>
                <li class="list">Testing frequency — the number of times an individual gets tested for HIV per year.</li>
                <li class="list">Partnering probability — likeliness that an individual enters a commits to a new relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main">
                According to a meta-analysis conducted by Baggaley, White, & Boily (2010), there is a 40.4% chance of transmission for per-partner unprotected receptive anal intercourse<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20406794/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>. Hence, we set the infection probability respectively.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Now let us see this in action, but with a population of 400 and 3% of it are initially infected. Note that in this simulation, no one uses a condom and refuses to get tested.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                To run the subsequent simulations, first, click the <b>initialize</b> button to generate the population. Then, click <b>run</b>.
            </p>
            <iframe id="html-sim-no-precaution" class="simulation-embed-small" src="/static/files/specifics/No Precaution.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>
            <p class="main">
                According to Mayo Clinic (2022), chronic to severe symptoms that make an individual realize that they might have HIV, usually nearing the stage of AIDS, appear in about 8 to 10 years<sup><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>. But for the sake of visualization of the simulation, the onset of symptoms is set to two years.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                The simulation above revealed that if nobody practices safe sex and declines to regularly get tested, HIV infects the entire population within 300 months or about 25 years. By then, the entire population is fully aware of their being HIV positive. Additionally, NIH (2021) says that if the disease is left untreated using antiretroviral therapy (ART), the virus will eventually progress to AIDS<sup><a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-basics" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                So, we add our first preventative strategy—condom use for the uninfected and HIV? individuals based on the percentage of the infected in the population. This is adapted from the study conducted by Li, Zhang, & Bi (2011)<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811016043" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">If the infected is 0%—10% of the population, HIV- & HIV? individuals remain practicing unprotected sex.</li>
                <li class="list">For 10%—20%, HIV- & HIV? individuals increase their use of condoms (30% of the time).</li>
                <li class="list">Lastly, if it is greater than 20%, HIV- & HIV? individuals will frequently use condoms (90% of the time).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main">
                Note that in the following simulations, persons that know they are HIV+ will always use condoms during sexual activities.
            </p>
            <iframe id="html-sim-using-condoms" class="simulation-embed-small" src="/static/files/specifics/Using Condoms.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>
            <p class="main">
                Initially, the cases of infected individuals seem to grow exponentially. But as soon as the reported cases of HIV+ reached around 25%-30%, new cases begin to  slow down, and eventually level out in the following months. This demonstrates that if people start to practice safe sex amid an HIV outbreak, it will, in time, mitigate new infections.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Smith et al. (2015) found that consistent condom use among serodiscordant homosexual partners (that is when the partners are aware that one is HIV+ and the other is not) is 70% effective against HIV transmission. Moreover, they concluded that there is no significant protection against an infection when they only use it occasionally<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaids/FullText/2015/03010/Condom_Effectiveness_for_HIV_Prevention_by.14.aspx" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Now, what if the population still prefers unprotected sex but gets tested for HIV according to the percentage of infected in the population?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">If 0%—10% of the population is HIV+, uninfected and unsuspected individuals refuse to get tested.</li>
                <li class="list">If 10%—20% of the population is HIV+, uninfected and unsuspected individuals would seldom get tested (<0.25 times/year).</li>
                <li class="list">And if it is greater than 20%, HIV- & HIV? individuals will frequently get tested (<1 time/year).</li>
            </ul>
            <iframe id="html-sim-frequent-testing" class="simulation-embed-small" src="/static/files/specifics/Frequent Testing.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>
            <p class="main">
                Like the simulation of condom use, increasing the frequency of HIV testing alleviates the transmission of HIV. In this simulation, as soon as the reported positive cases reached around 15%, people would often get tested. More HIV? updated their serostatus to HIV+ and subsequently used condoms for every sexual activity. Hence, the cases flattened much earlier than before. It goes to show that knowing your and your partner's serostatus is essential in preventing HIV contraction.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Bendavid et al. (2010) reported that there is a 55.5% reduction in new HIV infections over 10 years when the persons at risk have linkage to care. Additionally, this is greatly improved to around 69.7%-76.7% reduction when high-risk persons are given comprehensive HIV care<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921232/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Hmm. How about we add the abstinence or the tendency of an individual to enter a sexual relationship as a preventative measure? Just like previously, we form the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">If 0%—10% of the population is HIV+, uninfected and unsuspected individuals remain in forming new sexual relationships.</li>
                <li class="list">If 10%—20% of the population is HIV+, few uninfected and unsuspected individuals are starting to become wary of forming new sexual relationships (90% chance of forming new a relationship).</li>
                <li class="list">And if it is greater than 20%, HIV- & HIV? individuals are cautious about forming new sexual relationships (30% chance of forming new a relationship).</li>
            </ul>
            <iframe id="html-sim-relationship-tendency" class="simulation-embed-small" src="/static/files/specifics/Relationship Tendency.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>
            <p class="main">
                Just like the previous preventative measures, this one also leveled out the positive cases among the population. When the reported positive cases reached around 25% of the population, people are becoming more hesitant in entering sexual relationships, thus weakening the spread of the disease.  CDC (2020) says that abstinence is always effective against infection, and limiting sexual partners and activities lowers the chance of infection since one of its mediums of transmission is anal sex<sup><a href="https://hivrisk.cdc.gov/can-decrease-hiv-risk/" target="_blank">[13]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Now that we have explored each of the preventative measures and decision-making against infection from HIV, we are going to amass condom use, testing frequency, and partnering probability into a single simulation and formulate the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">If 0%—10% of the population is HIV+, HIV- & HIV? individuals take no precautionary measures.</li>
                <li class="list">If 10%—20% of the population is HIV+, HIV- & HIV? individuals increase their condom use, occasionally get tested, and be wary of forming new relationships.</li>
                <li class="list">And if it is greater than 20%, HIV- & HIV? individuals will use condoms, regularly get tested, and be cautious about forming new relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            <iframe id="html-sim-all-precautions" class="simulation-embed-small" src="/static/files/specifics/All Precautions.html" style="display:none;"></iframe>
            <a class="jump" href="#embedded-sim-all">
                <button class="jump">Jump to the comprehensive interactive simulation</button>
            </a>
            <p class="main">
                When the three preventative measures—condom use, frequent testing, and limiting sexual activities—are being observed by the population, the infected cases plateaus much earlier and quicker. If the reported cases rises much faster, people immediately follow the measures, flattening the curve almost immediately.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Out of the three simulated preventative measures, abstinence and limiting sexual activity proved to be the most effective. CDC (2019) estimates that in receptive anal intercourse, the risk of contracting HIV is about 138 per 10,000 exposures<sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html" target="_blank">[14]</a></sup>. Controlling one's sexual activity reduces the number of exposures, and abstaining 100% eliminates exposure.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Moreover, consistent condom use is currently one of the best ways to reduce exposure while maintaining sexual activity. Although not fully effective compared to abstinence, it is about 70% successful in preventing infection when always used according to the analysis and interviews conducted by Smith et al. (2015). They also noted that occasional use to never using the contraceptive provides no significant protection against exposure, greatly increasing the chance of infection<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaids/FullText/2015/03010/Condom_Effectiveness_for_HIV_Prevention_by.14.aspx" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Finally, frequent testing proved to be almost on par with persistent condom use. Although, it should not be used as the only preventative measure because in and of itself is not wholly a preventative measure. That is why in its simulation, the cases plateaued not entirely because of testing, but because HIV+ persons always practiced safe sex.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Testing only determines the HIV serostatus of an individual. It does not actively and directly prevent someone from contracting the virus. When disclosed between to-be partners, it influences both of their decision-making regarding sexual activities. For example, a person might refuse to have sexual relations with an HIV+ person. Furthermore, Marcus et al. (2017) concluded that periodic testing to update one's serostatus awareness and increased disclosure of serostatus are confirmed to be crucial to reducing HIV exposure, for they have an influence on the safe-sex practices of the partners<sup><a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2814-x" target="_blank">[15]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                All in all, combining the said measures is going to be the most effective in mitigating HIV exposure as demonstrated in the final simulation. NIH (2021) instructs that one should always practice safe sex by using condoms for it reduces the risk infection from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, talk with your medical practitioner to assess your risks and get frequent testing. Lastly, be mindful of and know your partner's STD and health history<sup><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menshealth/conditioninfo/risk" target="_blank">[16]</a></sup>.
